Credit Risk Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end process for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) for a credit risk dataset

The project focuses on handling data inconsistencies, outliers, and missing values, while also extracting meaningful insights through univariate and bivariate analysis.

This work is intended to serve as a foundation for advanced machine learning applications, such as predicting loan defaults.
